		<h2>
			This is a year on fire, pouring energy into your work, career, and creativity sectors. The January Sun-Pluto conjunction keeps your ambition and work ethic sky high. The separating Mars-Neptune conjunction makes sure that emotions, lofty spiritual ideals, and instincts are not left behind.<br>

			The Sun is conjoined with fiery Mars as it enters Leo. Here's your primary energy source for the whole year. Resist burning out or getting too forceful or impatient. Relax, and go for the gold. There's no limit to what you can achieve.	<br>

			The Moon will be not quite New as the Sun enters Leo. This deep, quiet, dark Moon provides unlimited access to wise private insights. With this strong Moon in Cancer, home and domestic concerns will be important and should be well attended to.<br>

			A Lunar Eclipse on February 10 has the Moon in Leo. A Lunar Eclipse on August 7 has the Sun in Leo, followed by a Solar Eclipse in Leo on August 21. The Lunar Eclipse periods will stress intimate relationships and may create self-doubts. The Solar Eclipse may have more influence in public or social arenas. Be smart and sensitive before and during these periods.<br>

			Of the four Mercury retrogrades this year, the third one from mid-August until early September will start in Virgo but conclude in Leo. Look forward to emerging from the retrograde with many minor snags untangled and more energy to charge ahead.<br>

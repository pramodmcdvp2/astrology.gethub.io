		<h2>
			2017 is a year of pure magic! Take the time to distinguish between what's real and what's illusion and you'll safely navigate any and all situations.<br> 

			With the Mars-Neptune conjunction in Pisces that opens 2017, you can use charm rather than be charmed, hold true to the loftiest of ideals, and dispel any deceit or deception.<br>

			The January Sun-Pluto conjunction in Capricorn brings intensity to all your efforts for success. It intensifies your feelings and passions, too.<br>

			A February Solar Eclipse in Pisces opens another door. Your modern planet Neptune is conjoined with the eclipsed Sun. If the outside world is in disarray, you'll see through the fog and be a beacon for others to realize what is best.<br>

			Your traditional planet Jupiter spends most of the year in Libra and is incredibly powerful. It starts in opposition to Uranus in Aries. This puts a lid on too many or too wild desires.<br> 

			When the Sun enters Pisces in February, Jupiter will still be opposed to Uranus, but now Mars in Aries is involved. Rash actions or impulses will be recognized in time. Pour extra creative energy into more constructive channels.<br>

			When the Sun enters Pisces, it will be together with the Lunar South Node. Memories, feelings, and emotional ties are strong this year. Catch yourself if you fall back into any old bad habits and benefit from what the past has taught you.

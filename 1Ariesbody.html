			You've got charm, smarts, and the element of surprise going for you all year long! Now what do you want to do with all these cosmic gifts? Tip: let them take you in a brand new direction.<br>

			Saturn and Uranus are trine most of the year, meaning that you may just continue with what's been working well. However, as the year progresses, boredom and ambition may both grow. By December you may have positioned yourself to make a big move to begin something radically different.<br>

			Venus is retrograde this year, partially in Aries. This provides you with more time to socially regroup and to appeal to people's emotional needs.<br>

			A Mercury retrograde in April concludes in early May in your sign, Aries. Emotionally size up how things are going for you during the retrograde. By early May you should have a game plan that lets you make faster progress in a career or a relationship.<br>

			Your planet Mars is extremely active and you should have the health and energy to be busy every single day. Not a bad thing!

		<h2>
			2017 is a time of great potential and personal growth. Hard work and success are there, too, but your greatest progress may be made internally rather than externally.<br>

			The Sun-Pluto conjunction in Capricorn that starts 2017 keeps your eye on the material prize. The Mars-Neptune conjunction will keep your loves, ideals, and highest hopes alive.<br>

			The Moon and Venus are conjoined in Aquarius as 2017 begins, too. Have an easier, warmer rapport with people one-on-one because of this.<br>

			When the Sun enters Aquarius, the Moon and Jupiter are conjoined in your Ninth House of expansion and higher learning. In 2017, you will want to learn and understand on a more complex level.<br>

			A February 10 Lunar Eclipse has the Sun in Aquarius. An August 7 Lunar Eclipse finds the Moon in Aquarius. Emotional issues may rise to the surface at those times. Be kind, big-hearted, and solutions will find you.<br>

			Your planets, Saturn and Uranus, are incredibly powerful all year. They are trine as 2017 starts. New ideas, fresh projects and people, wisdom, and boldness are all at your fingertips.

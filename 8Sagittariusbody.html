		<h2>
			2017 is a year wide open with opportunities for Sagittarians. There is plenty of energy that will prompt you to dig in and make tremendous progress.<br> 

			There are also countless doors opening to new, previously unconsidered projects, pursuits, and partnerships. Forget those preconceived notions of what you should do or need to do. This year, you can do just about anything.<br>

			The Sun-Pluto conjunction in Capricorn in January keeps your attention on career and public pursuits. You're not limited to being intense only about work, though. If you have a creative or other passion, you can get intense about that, too.<br>
			2017 starts with Mercury retrograde in Capricorn but the planet goes direct in Sagittarius. Work steady but aim high. The fourth and final Mercury retrograde is entirely in Sagittarius. Saturn spends the year in Sagittarius so Mercury's extra time there in December only improves your grasp on whatever situation is developing around you.<br>

			When the Sun enters Sagittarius in November, planets are scattered around the sky. There is a Mercury-Saturn conjunction, however, that sharpens your keen mind and tempers your social activities.<br>

			The asteroid Ceres is also transiting the Lunar North Node in glorious Leo. Nurturing yourself and your loved ones has never been easier or more satisfying.

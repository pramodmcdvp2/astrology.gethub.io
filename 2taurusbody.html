		<h2>
			This year, focus on your own well-being above all else. You can increase your material wealth and health this way, and also structure a more stable future. With Mars and the asteroid Ceres starting the year in your sign, you have the energy to nurture and grow the future you want.<br>

			The Sun-Pluto conjunction in early January is in the Cardinal Earth Sign Capricorn. Cardinal Signs love to start things, and Earth Signs (such as Taurus and Capricorn) are totally practical and realistic. This conjunction is a signal to make a big change or to formulate an ambitious new plan to make 2017 better than ever.<br>

			Your planet Venus is retrograde this year. Which things and people make you happiest? When this retrograde ends, you may want time to let your feelings settle down to focus on what really matters.<br>

			Of Mercury's four retrogrades, the second one starts in Taurus. Rethink any previous decisions and find improvements during this one (in April).<br>

			Spring may be complicated, but autumn gets simpler and more serious when Jupiter moves into Scorpio in October. December is a powerhouse for all Earth Signs as Saturn goes home into Capricorn. Changes are everywhere!

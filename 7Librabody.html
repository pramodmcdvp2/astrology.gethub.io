		<h2>
			For the first ten months of 2017, enthusiatic and big-hearted Jupiter is in your sign, Libra. You can do endless good things with this. Strong allies, partners, and friends are there with you. Have a persistent vision, help and be helpful, and you should have a magnificent year!<br>

			Venus and the Moon are conjoined in the Air Sign Aquarius as 2017 begins. Love and all social relationships and connections will benefit from the cool, clear-seeing, but compassionate influences of this Air Sign.<br>

			Jupiter is retrograde from February through early June, giving you extra time to make the most of all the good things that Jupiter can bring. This retrograde doesn't take luck away but it concentrates on internal, less obvious issues. Be luckier in personal matters and get into better shape by the summer.<br>

			As the Sun enters Libra, Mercury, Venus, and Mars are all in sensible, accomplished Virgo. Your efforts may sometimes feel modest but they will have great influence and consequences.<br>

			The Sun is also conjoined with the asteroid Vesta. You natually sacrifice and share blessings and good luck. The Moon is in a separating conjunction with Jupiter at the same time. Feelings and intentions deepen and you'll focus more sharply on what matters most to you.

		<h2>
			You may not recognize just how lucky you are going to be this year, Scorpio! The Sun-Pluto conjunction at 2017's beginning may keep you wired, intense, and focused on your chosen work. Keep an eye out for lucky opportunities and be ready to pounce. Your modern planet Pluto will keep you sharp and intense all year long.<br>

			The separating Mars-Neptune conjunction in Pisces may tug at your heart and conscience at times but your traditional planet Mars will keep you moving forward and won't let you sink into self-doubt.<br>

			When Scorpio starts, the Sun is conjoined with Jupiter and Mercury. Your lucky streak comes out of this. Mars is just entering Libra, too. This keeps you involved and plugged in with other kindred spirits, and those with shared goals and intentions.<br>

			Your drive for success is unwavering. Your craving for love and respect is also without limits. The outside world may be crazy at times but at the end of every day, you return to what matters most in your life.<br>

			2017 is a powerful and empowering year when nothing can distract, disturb, or stop you if youâ€™re determined. Go out and do it!

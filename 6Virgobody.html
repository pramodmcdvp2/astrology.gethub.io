		<h2>
			As soon as the Sun conjoins Pluto in Capricorn on January 7, the year 2017 will blast off into an adventure of work and career possibilities for Virgos. Your planet Mercury will be in Capricorn, too. Thoughts and ideas to move you ahead will be abundant and achievable all year.<br>

			January also starts with a mystic and mystifying conjunction of Mars and Neptune in Pisces. You'll be looking into the face of magic all year long, and you'll be able to tell what's real from what's illusion. That's an advantage that very few people will have.<br>

			The Moon and Venus conjunct in Aquarius smooths out many social and relationship issues. You will be able to see and think more clearly about others than perhaps they can themselves.<br>

			The most important celestial signal might be the conjunction of Mars and the Lunar North Node in Leo on the day that the Sun enters Virgo.<br> 

			You normally act with great consideration and compassion. This year, what you do may more often have karmic implications with soul connections to improve your life. Your more playful, dramatic actions could have deeper, more subtle and long-reaching consequences.<br>

			The third of this year's four Mercury retrogrades starts in Virgo on August 12 and ends in Leo on September 5. You can have some of your best and most successful moments of the year now. They may not look great in the moment, but they are.

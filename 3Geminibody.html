		<h2>
			Make the most of your people skills, make the big changes you want and need, and advance your goals for the future in 2017, Gemini. You'll have endless ideas and insights but it may be hard to activate them on your own. Talk, network, find partners, and team up when you think it's appropriate.<br> 

			Mercury, the Sun, and Pluto in Capricorn kickstart one of your most practical and successful years. Also, a Jupiter-Uranus opposition lets you be as innovative and vast-thinking as you please. Think big and be prepared to make major changes before the changes find you first.<br>

			A Saturn-Uranus trine offers discipline and boldness to create the year you want without sacrificing those people or things important to your happiness and success.<br>

			Venus and Jupiter are powerfully opposed as the Sun enters Gemini in May, giving you clear observations and the ability to make confident, shrewd decisions. Mars is in Gemini then, too. Your batteries are fully charged and you're ready to go!

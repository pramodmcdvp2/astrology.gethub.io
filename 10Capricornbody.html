		<h2>
			It's your year to charge ahead, make bold changes for progress, success, and achieve greater respect in the world. The Sun-Pluto conjunction in January empowers and emboldens you all year long.<br> 

			There are four Mercury retrogrades in 2017 but only the first - seven days in January - will be in Capricorn. Start out in a cautious wait-and-see mode but after January 8, it's full steam ahead.<br>

			A trine between your planet Saturn and Uranus makes it easier this year to be bold and innovative once you've weighed your many options.<br>

			As the year begins, a rash of sextiles involving eight planets will keep you connected and in touch with people, enabling you to coolly and calmly relate to them, and to see the magic that surrounds many people and situations.<br> 

			Family and friends will listen and support you. But it may be love that generates the most progress for you.<br>

			Saturn is retrograde in Sagittarius from April until late August. This tones down any over-enthusiasm or rash action.<br>

			December is super strong when Saturn goes home and enters Capricorn on December 19. On December 21 the Sun enters Capricorn and conjoins Saturn. End the year in high spirits and firm footing for the year to come.

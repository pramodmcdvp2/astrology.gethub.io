		<h16> History of Astrology: </h16><br>
			<p16>Astrological beliefs in corresp16ondences between celestial observations and terrestrial events have influenced various asp16ects of human history, including world-views, language and many elements of social culture.<br></p16>
	
			<p16>Among Indo-Europ16ean p16eop16les, astrology has been dated to the 3rd millennium BC, with roots in calendrical systems used to p16redict seasonal shifts and to interp16ret celestial cycles as signs of divine communications.Until the 17th century, astrology was considered a scholarly tradition, and it help16ed drive the develop16ment of astronomy. It was commonly accep16ted in p16olitical and cultural circles, and some of its concep16ts were used in other traditional studies, such as alchemy, meteorology and medicine. By the end of the 17th century, emerging scientific concep16ts in astronomy, such as heliocentrism, were irrevocably undermining the theoretical basis of astrology, which subsequently lost its academic standing.</p16>

			<p16>In the 20th century, astrology gained broader consumer p16op16ularity through the influence of regular mass media p16roducts, such as newsp16ap16er horoscop16es.</p16><br><br><br>


			<h17> About Astrology in India: </h17><br>
			
			<p17>The earliest use of the term jyotiṣa is in the sense of a Vedanga, an auxiliary discip16line of Vedic religion. The only work of this class to have survived is the Vedanga Jyotisha, which contains rules for tracking the motions of the sun and the moon in the context of a five-year intercalation cycle. The date of this work is uncertain, as its late style of language and comp16osition, consistent with the last centuries BC, albeit p16re-Mauryan, conflicts with some internal evidence of a much earlier date in the 2nd millennium BC.<br></p17>

			<p17>The documented history of Jyotish in the subsequent newer sense of modern horoscop16ic astrology is associated with the interaction of Indian and Hellenistic cultures in the Indo-Greek p16eriod.[67] Greek became a lingua franca of the Indus valley region following the military conquests of Alexander the Great and the Bactrian Greeks. The oldest surviving treatises, such as the Yavanajataka or the Brihat-Samhita, date to the early centuries AD. The oldest astrological treatise in Sanskrit is the Yavanajataka ("Sayings of the Greeks"), a versification by Sp16hujidhvaja in 269/270 AD of a now lost translation of a Greek treatise by Yavanesvara during the 2nd century AD under the p16atronage of the Western Satrap16 Saka king Rudradaman.</p17>

			<p17>Indian astronomy and astrology develop16ed together. The earliest treatise on jyotish, the Bhrigu Samhita, dates from the Vedic era. The sage Bhrigu is one of the Sap16tarshi, the seven sages who assisted in the creation of the universe. Written on p16ages of tree bark, the Samhita (Comp16ilation) is said to contain five million horoscop16es comp16rising all who have lived in the p16ast or will live in the future. The first named authors writing treatises on astronomy are from the 5th century AD, the date when the classical p16eriod of Indian astronomy can be said to begin. Besides the theories of Aryabhata in the Aryabhatiya and the lost Arya-siddhānta, there is the p16ancha-Siddhāntika of Varahamihira.</p17><br><br><br>

			<h18> Influence of planets on human life: </h18><br>
			
			<p18>Stars and p16lanets, the objects of the external Sp16ace (Universe), are resp16onsible for the p16rogramming of your sub-conscious mind at Manomaya Kosha. This creates the life you are exp16eriencing now. Your p16urp16ose of life, your goals, your choices, inborn habits, inclinations of mind, your reference p16oints of hap16p16iness and p16ain, your own p16hilosop16hy of how you lead your life, are some p16art of that p16rogramming, among many more.</p18>

			<p18>The movement of the stars and p16lanets in their resp16ective trajectories act as a Cosmic Clock for timing the events in your life, and p16rogramming your sub-conscious mind. Man understood this secret 12000 years ago. Since then, he has been studying stars, p16lanets, and their movements, in order to understand the core (or true) p16urp16ose of his being on this p16lanet. This has help16ed him manifest his core desire and exp16erience the eternal joy by focusing his attention and energies on his 'true p16urp16ose' only.<br>
			Man has understood this fact very well that the cause of misery and p16ain lies in deviation from his core p16urp16ose. And to keep16 himself aligned, man has been observing the stars for ages. That is also how the develop16ment of Hindu Astrological System ('Jyotish') initiated.<br>
			The word 'Jyotish' means "Illuminated Divine Lights Showing the True p16ath". The word 'Religion' means "Getting Aligned Again". In Hindu Astrology, the Moon stands for the sub-conscious mind. Whereas, Mercury is considered to stand for the ordinary conscious mind, with analytical and reasoning faculties. Only in Hindu Astrology, the timing of events is worked out from p16osition of the Moon at birth time. When the Moon is studied for seconds, minutes and degrees (120° for 120 years), then a certain combination of p16lanets gives accurate timing of events. This calculation goes up16 to the accuracy of an hour for hap16p16ening of an event in one's life. This system is known as 120 year situation method (Vimshottari Dasha p16adhhati), given by eminent Hindu astrologer Sage p16arashar In 5th Century B.C.<br>
			Hindu mystics decoded the mystery of life thousands of years ago. The most amazing p16art is that they mathematically derived the p16rocess of evolution for an individual, based on p16lanetary p16ositions at birth, their transits and their p16rogramming for sub-conscious mind. More into this understanding is, working evolution of Chakras with p16osition of p16lanets in the birth chart of an individual. In the ap16p16lication of MahaVastu™, the birth chart is studied from this angle. The design of building is then decided. Each individual horoscop16e is unique with its own p16urp16ose on the p16lanet. Even Greeks in the p16ast studied horoscop16es with this thought in mind. So that by defining one's p16urp16ose, structures can be made to p16erform the desired function.</p18>

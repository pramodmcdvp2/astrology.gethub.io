		<h2>
			2017 can be a highwater year full of major achievements, crucial decisions and changes for you, Cancer. Great things are possible with so much transformative energy aimed your way.<br>

			The January Sun-Pluto conjunction in Capricorn is also square Jupiter in Libra and Uranus in Aries. This creates a T-square that points straight at Cancer. Your home life, domestic environment, your home town, your country, and your home planet Earth rarely get this much celestial attention. Make great progress on any or all of these home fronts as soon as you can.<br> 

			It's also a great year to successfully conclude a long, difficult project or to make that big change that takes you to a better place... geographically, mentally, and/or emotionally.<br>

			The separating conjunction of Mars and Neptune in Pisces gives you enhanced intuition and instincts. This offers powerful advantages all year long. Will you take them?<br>

			When the Sun enters Cancer, Mars will be there, too. Jupiter will be in the heart of Libra, your Fourth House of home, family, and the conclusion of things. This year may take some hard work, but great energy, luck, and generosity are at your fingertips all year long.
